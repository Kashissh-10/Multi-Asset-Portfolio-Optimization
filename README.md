**Project:**
 Multi-Asset Portfolio Optimization & Efficient Frontier in Excel

**Tools Used:**
Microsoft Excel, Solver, Data Analysis ToolPak, Random Simulation

# Project Overview:
Constructed an optimal investment portfolio from multiple financial assets (Stocks, Bonds and Gold) using Excel. The objective was to identify the most efficient portfolio that maximizes return for a given level of risk, or minimizes risk for a given level of return, by analyzing asset correlations and risk metrics through a **covariance matrix** and **random simulations.**
